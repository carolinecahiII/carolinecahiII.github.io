            i'm a narrative spinner, sometimes frontend-fiddler and sometimes-designer with a deep love for good UI and stories that suck you in for weeks at a time. i'm a jack of all trades, and hope one day to be a master of at least <em>some.</em>
         </h3>

         <p>a lot of things on the internet, imporant things like government sites and informational graphics we need to 
            understand, don't make any sense. <em><strong>why is that?</strong></em><br><br> i'm motivated by turning the 
            frustration of battling bad UI into a data-based solution that makes people's lives easier, and the world a more 
            user-friendly place.
            <br><br>web design is more than fonts and color palettes; in the world we live in, making information readily 
            available and understandable is crucial to media literacy, human empathy, and cross-cultural exchange. 
            <br><br>
            i feel most accomplished when i can use thoughtful design, good writing, and intuitive UI/UX to help people understand 
            something they might have otherwise given up on.</p>

            <p> my values are a huge part of what inspires me to do my best work. most recently, I worked in the brown university library as a <strong>senior library technologist.</strong> <br><br>
                most of my work involved collaboration with <a class="blue" href="https://library.brown.edu/create/cds/projects/">amazing digital scholarship projects</a> and 
                other interesting library initiatives, like the incredible oral history project <a class="blue" href="https://library.brown.edu/create/building-a-bridge-back-to-brown/timeline/">building a bridge back to brown project.</a>

             <p>i also love playing (note: losing), talking about, and studying <strong>video games.</strong> like many of my generation, i've been hooked since my dad let me mess around on his copy of <em>skyrim</em> back in 2011.</p>
             <p>i got into studying the sociology of gaming and the idea of gameification during my time at boston university, where i took an incredible course with the legendary dr. takeo rivera called <strong>technoculture and horizons of gender & race: cyborgs, goddesses, and gamers</strong> that rocked my world and changed the course of my studies.</p>
             <p>ever since then i've been thinking about how gameification fits into our lives. how can we use game theory to make things like taxes, learning, media etc. more engaging? how do the games we play reveal what we value or fear? how do they tell us who we are?</p>

             <p>when i'm not sitting in front of a screen, i'm usually wrapped up in one of the following activities:</p>

                <li>fighting caterpillars in my vegetable garden</li>
                <li>propagating a houseplant despite not having room for any more vegetation in my apartment</li>
                <li>listening to <a href="https://radiolab.org/">radiolab</a></li>
                <li>planning a dnd campaign</li>
                <li>working on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2gEbbAsoh2aHjBx8QLAJO7?si=foGWSrNNTD6X3O1LRflwXg">next great american anti-folk record</a></li>
