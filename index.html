                    <h3>TL:DR;</h3>
                    <p>I feel most accomplished when I can use thoughtful development and intuitive design 
                        choices to help people understand something they might have otherwise given up on.
                    </p>
                    <p>I’ve always loved media that made me slightly disgruntled; that ‘why didn’t I think of 
                        that!’ feeling. I learned how to design and code digital products so I could bring my 
                        own projects with that same effect. I pull from the research, experiences, and media that 
                        have inspired me all my life to build familiar yet innovative design work.

                    <h3>Backstory</h3>
                    <p>I’ve worn a lot of hats over my career so far, and they’ve each given me a unique perspective. 
                        As the child of Irish emigrant parents, spending my early years between Dublin and the USA kept 
                        me from being tied to a single culture. I soaked up as much inspiration from moss-bearded 
                        ruins and ancient ruins as I did the neon lights and painted deli windows of New 
                        Jersey.
                    </p>
                    <p>My undergrad degree helped me build strong writing, research, and analytical skills. 
                        My early 20s were spent obsessing over media theories, diving deep into sociological 
                        research, and writing papers on what I found. I care about projects that inspire that kind of
                        intrigue, creativity and passion.

                        was developed as thesis project of my Master's degree program within a team of five colleagues. I provided backend assistance and 
                        conducted sociological research and librarian interviews, as well as designed and implemented in-game sprites and assets.
                        <br><br>
                        We completed a fully playable RPG with over 70,000 words of dialogue and three hours of playtime in just under three months and received
                        a first class honors distinction after our defense.
