               i'm a frontend developer and interactive digital media designer. i’m happiest when i can make something exciting and dynamic out of something boring, hard to use, or complicated.
            </h3>
            <br>
            <p>a lot of things on the internet, important things like government sites and informational graphics we need to 
               understand, don't make any sense. <em><strong>that's annoying!</strong></em><br><br> i'm motivated by turning the 
               frustration of battling bad ui into a data-based solution that makes people's lives easier, and the world a more 
               user-friendly place. i also believe that strong development skills should include a healthy dose of creativity and fun (the website you’re reading right now is an example of that!).
               <br><br>web development is more than fonts and color palettes; in the world we live in, making information readily 
               available and understandable is crucial to media literacy, human empathy, and cross-cultural exchange. 
               <br><br>
               i feel most accomplished when i can use thoughtful development, intuitive design, and thoughtful collaboration to help people understand 
               something they might have otherwise given up on.</p>

               <p>at trinity college dublin, i’m pursuing a master’s of science degree in interactive digital media. some things i’ve worked on during this time:
                  <ul>
                     <li>comprehensive full lifecycle web development, including:</li>

                     <li>c++ development, applied particularly to sensor technologies</li>
                  </ul>
                  notable projects:
                  <ul>
                     <li>taproot: a data visualization project made with visual computing software</li>
                     <li>mise: a photo-sharing site designed as an alternative to substack for food/chef writing</li>
                  </ul>
               </p>
             <br>
             <hr>
             <p>i also love playing (note: losing), talking about, and studying <strong>video games.</strong> like many of my generation, i've been hooked since my dad let me mess around on his copy of <em>skyrim</em> back in 2011.</p>
             <p>i got into studying the sociology of gaming and the idea of gameification during my time at boston university, where i took an incredible course with the legendary dr. takeo rivera called <strong>technoculture and horizons of gender & race: cyborgs, goddesses, and gamers</strong> that rocked my world and changed the course of my studies.</p>
             <p>ever since then i've been thinking about how gameification fits into our lives. how can we use game theory to make things like taxes, learning, media etc. more engaging? how do the games we play reveal what we value or fear? how do they tell us who we are?</p>
             <br>
             <hr>
             <p>when i'm not sitting in front of a screen, i'm usually wrapped up in one of the following activities:</p>
             <ol>
               <li>writing interactive narratives in twine, then using (trying to figure out) unity to make it a video game</li>
               <li>designing posters for my apartment</li>
               <li>listening to <a href="https://radiolab.org/">radiolab</a></li>
               <li>planning a dnd campaign</li>
               <li>working on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2gebbasoh2ahjbx8qlajo7?si=fogwsrnntd6x3o1lrflwxg">next great american anti-folk record</a></li>
            </ol>
             <br>
             <hr>
             <p>when i'm not in grad school, i live in new england with my wonderful partner and our extremely grumpy tuxedo cat (pictured).</p>
